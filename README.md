## Request a feature (or report a bug) for [Laravel Factory](https://laravelfactory.com)

> This repository is used to track feature requests and bug reports of Laravel Factory. We use Issues feature of Github which is quite powerful and there is no need for a dedicated feature request tracking system. Here are the quick steps to follow:

|||

| ![Click on issues tab](./click-on-issues-tab.png "Click on issues tab")|**Step:1 Click on the issues tab at the top.**|
|**Step:2 Search in the Filters to check if similar request is already submitted**|![Find if similar request is already submitted](./find-if-similar-request-is-already-submitted.png "Find if similar request is already submitted") |
|![Vote for existing requests](./vote-for-existing-requests.png "Vote for existing requests")|**Step:3 If there is already a similar request, you may vote for it and comment for any additional info.**|
|**Step:4 If not, you may go ahead and create a new issue for your request**|![Create a new issue](./create-a-new-issue.png "Create a new issue")|

> We would label your request accordingly and keep you updated.
